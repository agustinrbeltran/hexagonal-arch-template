# Overview

📘 This FastAPI-based project demonstrates a practical implementation of **Hexagonal Architecture** (Ports and Adapters) with feature-based organization. It incorporates Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) principles and elements of Domain-Driven Design (DDD). While not meant to serve as a comprehensive reference or a strict application of these methodologies, the project shows how their core ideas can be effectively applied in Python. If these patterns are new to you, refer to the [Useful Resources](#useful-resources) section.

This template evolved from a Clean Architecture implementation with layered organization into a true hexagonal architecture with explicit ports, adapters, and feature-based bounded contexts. See [About This Template](#about-this-template) for the relationship to the original work.

## About This Template

This project is a fork and evolution of [fastapi-clean-example](https://github.com/ivan-borovets/fastapi-clean-example) by **Ivan Borovets**. While the original project demonstrated Clean Architecture with layered organization, this template has been refactored to implement true Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters) with feature-based organization.

**Key Changes from Original:**
- Migrated from layered structure (domain/application/infrastructure/presentation) to feature-based hexagonal architecture (features with ports/adapters)
- Explicit port abstractions (inbound/outbound) for each feature
- Feature-based bounded contexts instead of global layers
- Enhanced developer tooling (comprehensive Makefile, improved code quality automation)

Credit to Ivan Borovets for the excellent foundation and architecture patterns. This template builds upon his work to demonstrate an alternative architectural approach.

# Architecture Principles

## Introduction

This repository may be helpful for those seeking backend implementation in
Python that is both framework-agnostic and storage-agnostic (unlike Django).
Such flexibility can be achieved by using a web framework that doesn't impose
strict software design (like FastAPI) and applying a layered architecture
patterned after the one proposed by Robert Martin, which we'll explore further.

The original explanation of Clean Architecture concepts can be found
[here](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).
If you're still wondering why Clean Architecture matters, read the article — it
only takes about 5 minutes. In essence, it’s about making your application
independent of external systems and highly testable.

> "A computer program is a detailed description of the **policy** by which
> inputs are transformed into outputs."
>
> — Robert Martin

The most abstract policies define core business rules, while the least abstract
ones handle I/O operations. Being closer to implementation details, less
abstract policies are more likely to change. **Layer** represents a collection
of components expressing policies at the same level of abstraction.

Concentric circles represent boundaries between different layers. The meaning of
arrows in the diagram will be discussed [later](#dependency-rule). For now, we
will focus on the purpose of the layers.

## Layered Approach

![#gold](https://placehold.co/15x15/gold/gold.svg) **Domain Layer**

- **Domain model** is a set of concepts, rules and behaviors that define what
  business (context) is and how it operates. It is expressed in **ubiquitous
  language** — consistent terminology shared by developers and domain experts.
  Domain layer implements domain model in code; this implementation is often
  called domain model.
- The strictest domain rules are **invariants** — conditions that must always
  hold true for the model. Enforcing invariants means maintaining data
  consistency in the model. This can be achieved through **encapsulation**,
  which hides internal state and couples data with behavior.
- Building blocks of domain model are (not limited to these):
  - **value objects** — smart business types (no identity, immutable, equal by
    value).
  - **entities** — business objects (have identity and lifecycle, equal by
    identity).
  - **domain services** — containers for behavior that has no place in the
    components above.
- Other domain model building blocks, unused in this project but important for
  deeper DDD:
  - **aggregates** — clusters of entities (1+) that must change together as a
    single unit, managed exclusively through their root, defining boundaries of
    transactional consistency.
  - **repositories** — abstractions emulating collections of aggregate roots.
- Domain model lies on a spectrum from anemic to rich.
  - **anemic** — simple data types, entities are just data holders, rules and
    behaviors live outside.
  - **rich** — value objects and entities encapsulate data and rules; invariants
    are enforced internally, so the model itself prevents invalid states. For
    components: anemic means no behavior within, rich — the contrary.
- Domain services originally represent operations that don't naturally belong to
  a specific entity or value object. But in projects with anemic entities, they
  can also contain logic that would otherwise be in those entities.
- In early stages of development when the domain model is not yet clearly
  defined, I'd recommend keeping entities flat and anemic, even though the
  latter weakens encapsulation. Once domain logic is well established, some
  entities can, as aggregate roots, become non-flat and rich. This best enforces
  invariants but can be tricky to design once and for all.
- Prefer rich value objects early, freeing entities and services from an
  excessive burden of local rules.
- Consider domain layer the most important, stable, and independent part of a
  system.

![#red](https://placehold.co/15x15/red/red.svg) **Application Layer**

- Business defines **use case** as specification of observable behavior that
  delivers value by achieving a goal.
- Within use case, the behavior is enacted by **actor** — possibly a client of
  the software system.
- Actor performs use case in steps, some of which require interaction with the
  system. These stepwise interactions with the system are handled at the
  application layer by **interactors**. In other words, each interactor handles
  a single business operation matching a step within use case.
- Interactors are stateless and cannot call each other, unlike use cases. Each
  is invoked independently - typically by external drivers such as HTTP
  controllers, message consumers, or scheduled jobs.
- Interactor orchestrates domain logic and external calls needed to perform the
  operation. Its primary responsibilities may include permission verification
  and transaction management. To access external systems, interactors rely on
  **interfaces (ports)** that abstract infrastructure details.
- Interactor uses **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)** to exchange serializable data
  with external layers. These are simple, behavior-free carriers - the
  cross-layer transport for external contracts.
- If logic is reused across interactors: extract an application service when it
  falls under typical interactor responsibilities; otherwise, consider evolving
  the domain model to include it. Such evolution is a normal part of model
  enrichment.
- Together, domain and application layers form the **core** of the system.

![#green](https://placehold.co/15x15/green/green.svg) **Infrastructure Layer**

- This layer is responsible for adapting the core to external systems.
- It consists of **adapters**: driving and driven. Driving adapters call into
  the core, translating external requests into interactor calls. Driven adapters
  (port implementations) are called by the core via ports, allowing the core to
  interact with external systems (databases, APIs, file systems, etc.) while
  keeping the business logic decoupled.
- Related adapter logic can be grouped into **infrastructure service**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Clean Architecture doesn't prescribe any particular number of layers. The
>   key is to follow the Dependency Rule, which is explained in the next
>   section.

## Dependency Rule

A dependency occurs when one software component relies on another to operate. If
you were to split all blocks of code into separate modules, dependencies would
manifest as imports between those modules. Typically, dependencies are
graphically depicted in UML style in such a way that

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - `A -> B` (**A points to B**) means **A depends on B**.

The key principle of Clean Architecture is the **Dependency Rule**. This rule
states that **more abstract software components must not depend on more concrete
ones.** In other words, dependencies must never point outwards.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Domain and application layers may import external tools and libraries to the
>   extent necessary for describing business logic - those that extend the
>   programming language's capabilities (math/numeric utilities, time zone
>   conversion, object modeling, etc.). This trades some core stability for
>   clarity and expressiveness. What is not acceptable are dependencies that
>   bind business logic to implementation details (including frameworks) or to
>   out-of-process systems (databases, brokers, file systems, cloud SDKs, etc.).
> - Components within the same layer **can depend on each other.** For example,
>   components in the Infrastructure layer can interact with one another without
>   crossing into other layers.
> - Components in any outer layer can depend on components in any inner layer,
>   not necessarily the one closest to them. For example, components in the
>   Presentation layer can directly depend on the Domain layer, bypassing the
>   Application and Infrastructure layers.
> - Avoid letting business logic leak into peripheral details, such as raising
>   business-specific exceptions in the Infrastructure layer without re-raising
>   them in the business logic or declaring domain rules outside the Domain
>   layer.
> - In specific cases where database constraints enforce business rules, the
>   Infrastructure layer may raise domain-specific exceptions, such as
>   `UsernameAlreadyExistsError` for a `UNIQUE CONSTRAINT` violation. Handling
>   these exceptions in the Application layer ensures that any business logic
>   implemented in adapters remains under control.
> - Avoid introducing elements in inner layers that specifically exist to
>   support outer layers. For example, you might be tempted to place something
>   in the Application layer that exists solely to support a specific piece of
>   infrastructure. At first glance, based on imports, it might seem that the
>   Dependency Rule isn't violated. However, in reality, you've broken the core
>   idea of the rule by embedding infrastructure concerns (more concrete) into
>   the business logic (more abstract).

### Note on Adapters

The **Infrastructure layer** in Clean Architecture acts as the adapter layer —
connecting the application to external systems. In this project, we treat both
**Infrastructure** and **Presentation** as adapters, since both adapt the
application to the outside world. Speaking of dependencies direction, the
diagram by R. Martin in Figure 1 can, without significant loss, be replaced by a
more concise and pragmatic one — where the adapter layer serves as a "bridge",
depending both on the internal layers of the application and external
components. This adjustment implies **reversing** the arrow from the blue layer
to the green layer in R. Martin's diagram.

The proposed solution is a **trade-off**. It doesn't strictly follow R. Martin's
original concept but avoids introducing excessive abstractions with
implementations outside the application's boundaries. Pursuing purity on the
outermost layer is more likely to result in overengineering than in practical
gains.

My approach retains nearly all advantages of Clean Architecture while
simplifying real-world development. When needed, adapters can be removed along
with the external components they're written for, which isn't a significant
issue.

Let’s agree, for this project, to revise the principle:

Original:

> "Dependencies must never point outwards."

Revised:

> "Dependencies must never point outwards **within the core**."

## Layered Approach Continued

![#blue](https://placehold.co/15x15/blue/blue.svg) **Presentation Layer**

> [!NOTE]
> In the original diagram, the Presentation layer isn't explicitly distinguished
> and is instead included within the Interface Adapters layer. I chose to
> introduce it as a separate layer, marked in blue, as I see it as even more
> external compared to typical adapters.

- This layer handles external requests and includes **controllers** that
  validate inputs and pass them to the interactors in the Application layer.
  More abstract layers of the program assume that request data is already
  validated, allowing them to focus solely on their core logic.
- Controllers must be as thin as possible, containing no logic beyond basic
  input validation and routing. Their role is to act as an intermediary between
  the application and external systems (e.g., FastAPI).

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - **_Basic_** validation, like checking whether the structure of the incoming
>   request matches the structure of the defined request model (e.g., type
>   safety and required fields) should be performed by controllers at this
>   layer, while **_business rule_** validation (e.g., ensuring the email domain
>   is allowed, verifying the uniqueness of username, or checking if a user
>   meets the required age) belongs to the Domain or Application layer.
> - Business rule validation often involves relationships between fields, such
>   as ensuring that a discount applies only within a specific date range or a
>   promotion code is valid for orders above a certain total.
> - **Carefully** consider using Pydantic for business rule validation. While
>   convenient, Pydantic models are slower than regular dataclasses and reduce
>   application core stability by coupling business logic to an external
>   library.
> - If you choose Pydantic (or a similar tool bundled with web framework) for
>   business model definitions, ensure that a Pydantic model in business layers
>   is a separate model from the one in the Presentation layer, even if their
>   structure appears identical. Mixing data presentation logic with business
>   logic is a common mistake made early in development to save effort on
>   creating separate models and field mapping, often due to not understanding
>   that structural similarities are temporary.

![#gray](https://placehold.co/15x15/gray/gray.svg) **External Layer**

> [!NOTE]
> In the original diagram, external components are included in the blue layer
> (Frameworks & Drivers). I've marked them in gray to clearly distinguish them
> from layers within the application's boundaries.

- This layer represents fully external components such as web frameworks (e.g.
  FastAPI itself), databases, third-party APIs, and other services.
- These components operate outside the application’s core logic and can be
  easily replaced or modified without affecting the business rules, as they
  interact with the application only through the Presentation and Infrastructure
  layers.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/dep_graph_basic.svg" alt="Basic Dependency Graph" />
  <br><em>Figure 3: Basic Dependency Graph</em>
</p>

## Dependency Inversion

The **dependency inversion** technique enables reversing dependencies **by
introducing an interface** between components, allowing an inner layer to
communicate with an outer layer while adhering to the Dependency Rule.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/dep_graph_inv_corrupted.svg" alt="Corrupted Dependency" />
  <br><em>Figure 4: <b>Corrupted</b> Dependency</em>
</p>

In this example, the Application component depends directly on the
Infrastructure component, violating the Dependency Rule. This creates
"corrupted" dependencies, where changes in the Infrastructure layer can
propagate to and unintentionally affect the Application layer.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/dep_graph_inv_correct.svg" alt="Correct Dependency" />
  <br><em>Figure 5: <b>Correct</b> Dependency</em>
</p>

In the correct design, the Application layer component depends on an
**abstraction (port)**, and the Infrastructure layer component **implements**
the corresponding interface. This makes the Infrastructure component an adapter
for the port, effectively turning it into a plugin for Application layer. Such a
design adheres to the **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**, minimizing the
impact of infrastructure changes on core business logic.

## Dependency Injection

The idea behind **Dependency Injection** is that a component shouldn't create
the dependencies it needs but rather receive them. From this definition, it's
clear that one common way to implement DI is by passing dependencies as
arguments to the `__init__` method or functions.

But how exactly should these dependencies be initialized (and finalized)?

**DI frameworks** offer an elegant solution by automatically creating necessary
objects (while managing their **lifecycle**) and injecting them where needed.
This makes the process of dependency injection much cleaner and easier to
manage.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/dep_graph_inv_correct_di.svg" alt="Correct Dependency with DI" />
  <br><em>Figure 6: <b>Correct</b> Dependency <b>with DI</b></em>
</p>

FastAPI provides a built-in **DI mechanism** called
[Depends](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/), which tends to
leak into different layers of the application. This creates tight coupling to
FastAPI, violating the principles of Clean Architecture, where the web framework
belongs to the outermost layer and should remain easily replaceable.

Refactoring the codebase to remove `Depends` when switching frameworks can be
unnecessarily costly. It also has
[other limitations](https://dishka.readthedocs.io/en/stable/alternatives.html#why-not-fastapi)
that are beyond the scope of this README. Personally, I prefer
[**Dishka**](https://dishka.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) — a solution
that avoids these issues and remains framework-agnostic.

## CQRS

The project implements Command Query Responsibility Segregation (**CQRS**) — a
pattern that separates read and write operations into distinct paths.

- **Commands** (via interactors) handle write operations and business-critical
  reads using command gateways that work with entities and value objects.
- **Queries** are implemented through query services (similar contract to
  interactors) that use query gateways to fetch data optimized for presentation
  as query models.

This separation enables:

- Efficient read operations through specialized query gates, avoiding loading
  complete entity models.
- Performance optimization by tailoring data retrieval to specific view
  requirements.
- Flexibility to combine data from multiple models in read operations with
  minimal field selection.

  <br><em>Figure 7: Application Controller - Interactor</em>
  </p>

In the presentation layer, a Pydantic model appears when working with FastAPI
and detailed information needs to be displayed in OpenAPI documentation. You
might also find it convenient to validate certain fields using Pydantic;
however, be cautious to avoid leaking business rules into the presentation
layer.

For request data, a plain `dataclass` is often sufficient. Unlike lighter
alternatives, it provides attribute access, which is more convenient for working
in the application layer. However, such access is unnecessary for data returned
to the client, where a `TypedDict` is sufficient (it's approximately twice as
fast to create as a dataclass with slots, with comparable access times).

  </p>

An infrastructure handler may be required as a temporary solution in cases where
a separate context exists but isn't physically separated into a distinct domain
(e.g., not implemented as a standalone module within a monolithic application).
In such cases, the handler operates as an application-level interactor but
resides in the infrastructure layer.

Initially, I called these handlers interactors, but the community reacted very
negatively to the idea of interactors in the infrastructure layer, refusing to
acknowledge that these essentially belong to another context.

In this application, such handlers include those managing user accounts, such as
registration, login, and logout.

Ports in infrastructure are not commonly seen — typically, only concrete
implementations are present. However, in this project, since we have a separate
layer of adapters (presentation) located outside the infrastructure, ports are
necessary to comply with the dependency rule.

**Identity Provider (IdP)** abstracts authentication details, linking the main
business context with the authentication context. In this example, the
authentication context is not physically separated, making it an infrastructure
detail. However, it can potentially evolve into a separate domain.

  <br><em>Figure 13: Identity Provider</em>

Normally, IdP is expected to provide all information about current user.
However, in this project, since roles are not stored in sessions or tokens,
retrieving them in main context was more natural.

## Structure

This project implements **Hexagonal Architecture** (Ports and Adapters) with feature-based organization. Each feature is a bounded context containing its own hexagon with clearly separated domain logic, ports (abstractions), adapters (implementations), and entrypoints.

### Key Architecture Patterns

**Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters):**
- Each feature is a **hexagon** with a clear boundary defined by ports
- **Ports** are abstractions (interfaces) that define how the domain interacts with the outside world:
  - **Inbound ports** (driving): Use case interfaces that external actors invoke
  - **Outbound ports** (driven): Gateway interfaces that the domain uses to interact with infrastructure
- **Adapters** are concrete implementations of ports that connect to external systems (databases, frameworks, etc.)
- **Domain** contains business logic and depends only on port abstractions, never on adapters

**Feature-Based Organization:**
- Business capabilities are organized into features (`account`, `user`) rather than technical layers
- Each feature is a bounded context with its own domain model, ports, adapters, and entrypoints
- Common shared concerns live in `/common` and are reused across features

**Dependency Rule:**
- Dependencies point inward: `entrypoint` → `domain/port/inbound` → `domain/core` ← `domain/port/outbound` ← `adapter`
- Domain layer has **zero dependencies** on outer layers (framework-agnostic, storage-agnostic)
- Adapters and entrypoints depend on domain ports (abstractions), not on each other

**CQRS Pattern:**
- Write operations: Commands flow through use cases → domain services → repository
- Read operations: Queries can bypass domain layer for optimized reads (see `user_queries.py`)

## API

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/handlers.png" alt="Handlers" />
  <br><em>Figure 14: Handlers</em>
</p>

### General

- `/` (GET): Open to **everyone**.
  - Redirects to Swagger documentation.
- `/api/v1/health` (GET): Open to **everyone**.
  - Returns `200 OK` if the API is alive.

### Account (`/api/v1/account`)

- `/signup` (POST): Open to **everyone**.
  - Registers a new user with validation and uniqueness checks.
  - Passwords are peppered, salted, and stored as hashes.
  - A logged-in user cannot sign up until the session expires or is terminated.
- `/login` (POST): Open to **everyone**.
  - Authenticates registered user, sets a JWT access token with a session ID in
    cookies, and creates a session.
  - A logged-in user cannot log in again until the session expires or is
    terminated.
  - Authentication renews automatically when accessing protected routes before
    expiration.
  - If the JWT is invalid, expired, or the session is terminated, the user loses
    authentication. [^1]
- `/password` (PUT): Open to **authenticated users**.
  - The current user can change their password.
  - New password must differ from current password.
- `/logout` (DELETE): Open to **authenticated users**.
  - Logs the user out by deleting the JWT access token from cookies and removing
    the session from the database.

### Users (`/api/v1/users`)

- `/` (POST): Open to **admins**.
  - Creates a new user, including admins, if the username is unique.
  - Only super admins can create new admins.
- `/` (GET): Open to **admins**.
  - Retrieves a paginated list of existing users with relevant information.
- `/{user_id}/password` (PUT): Open to **admins**.
  - Admins can set passwords of subordinate users.
- `/{user_id}/roles/admin` (PUT): Open to **super admins**.
  - Grants admin rights to a specified user.
  - Super admin rights cannot be changed.
- `/{user_id}/roles/admin` (DELETE): Open to **super admins**.
  - Revokes admin rights from a specified user.
  - Super admin rights cannot be changed.
- `/{user_id}/activation` (PUT): Open to **admins**.
  - Restores a previously soft-deleted user.
  - Only super admins can activate other admins.
- `/{user_id}/activation` (DELETE): Open to **admins**.
  - Soft-deletes an existing user, making that user inactive.
  - Also deletes the user's sessions.
  - Only super admins can deactivate other admins.
  - Super admins cannot be soft-deleted.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Super admin privileges must be initially granted manually (e.g., directly in
>   the database), though the user account itself can be created through the
>   API.

## Configuration

> [!WARNING]
>
> - This part of documentation is **not** related to the architecture approach.
> - Use any configuration method you prefer.

### Files

- **config.toml**: Main application settings organized in sections
- **export.toml**: Lists fields to export to .env
  (`export.fields = ["postgres.USER", "postgres.PASSWORD", ...]`)
- **.secrets.toml**: Optional sensitive data (same format as config.toml, merged
  with main config)

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - This project includes secret files for demonstration purposes only. In a
>   real project, you **must** ensure that `.secrets.toml` and all `.env` files
>   are not tracked by version control system to prevent exposing sensitive
>   information. See this project's `.gitignore` for an example of how to
>   properly exclude these sensitive files from Git.

### Flow

In this project I use my own configuration system based on TOML files as the
single source of truth. The system generates `.env` files for Docker and
infrastructure components while the application reads settings directly from the
structured TOML files. More details are available at
https://github.com/ivan-borovets/toml-config-manager

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/toml_config_manager.svg" alt="Configuration flow" />
  <br><em>Figure 15: Configuration flow </em>
  <br><small>Here, the arrows represent usage flow, <b>not dependencies.</b></small>
</p>

### Local Environment

1. Configure local environment

- In this project, local configuration is already prepared in `config/local/`.\
  Nothing needs to be created — adjust files only if you want to change
  defaults.
- If you want to adjust settings, edit the existing TOML files in
  `config/local/` directly.\
  `.env.local` will be generated automatically — **don’t** create or edit it
  manually.
- Docker Compose in this project is already configured with `APP_ENV`.\
  Just keep in mind this variable if you change the setup:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    # ...
    environment:
      APP_ENV: ${APP_ENV}
```

2. Set environment variable

```shell
export APP_ENV=local
# export APP_ENV=dev
# export APP_ENV=prod
```

3. Check it and generate `.env`

```shell
# Probably you'll need Python 3.13 installed on your system to run these commands. 
# The next code section provides commands for its fast installation.
make env  # should print APP_ENV=local
make dotenv  # should tell you where .env.local was generated
```

4. Install `uv`

```shell
# sudo apt update
# sudo apt install pipx
# pipx ensurepath
# pipx install uv
# https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#shell-autocompletion
# uv python install 3.13  # To install Python
```

5. Set up virtual environment

```shell
uv sync --group dev
source .venv/bin/activate

# Alternatively,
# uv v
# source .venv/bin/activate  # on Unix
# .venv\Scripts\activate  # on Windows
# uv pip install -e . --group dev
```

Don't forget to tell your IDE where the interpreter is located.

Install pre-commit hooks:

```shell
# https://pre-commit.com/
pre-commit install
```

6. Launch

- To run only the database in Docker and use the app locally, use the following
  command:

  ```shell
  make up.db
  # make up.db-echo
  ```

- Then, start Supabase and apply migrations:
  ```shell
  supabase start
  # Migrations are automatically applied when Supabase starts
  ```

- After Supabase is running, the database is ready, and you can launch the
  application locally (e.g., through your IDE). Remember to set the `APP_ENV`
  environment variable in your IDE's run configuration.

- To run via Docker Compose:

  ```shell
  make up
  # make up.echo
  ```

  In this case, migrations will be applied automatically at startup.

7. Shutdown

- To stop the containers, use:
  ```shell
  make down
  ```

### Other Environments (dev/prod)

1. Use the instructions about [local environment](#local-environment) above

- But make sure you've created similar structure in `config/dev` or
  `config/prod` with [files](#files):
  - `config.toml`
  - `.secrets.toml`
  - `export.toml`
  - `docker-compose.yaml` if needed
- `.env.dev` or `.env.prod` to be generated later — **don't** create them
  manually

### Adding New Environments

1. Add new value to `ValidEnvs` enum in `config/toml_config_manager.py` (and
   maybe in your app settings)
2. Update `ENV_TO_DIR_PATHS` mapping in the same file (and maybe in your app
   settings)
3. Create corresponding directory in `config/` folder
4. Add required configuration [files](#files)

Environment directories can also contain other env-specific files like
`docker-compose.yaml`, which will be used by Makefile commands.

[^1]: Session and token share the same expiry time, avoiding database reads if
    the token is expired. This scheme of using JWT **is not** related to OAuth
    2.0 and is a custom micro-optimization.
